# lsipod
You want to copy music files from an iOS device to your PC, and you want to select files based on title, artist, and album, rather than a meaningless four-character filename. This utility lists the meaningless four-character filename paths that match the tracks you want. That is all. You do the copying yourself.

Requires libgpod, and does not use fusepod.
